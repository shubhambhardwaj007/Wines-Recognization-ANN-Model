Artificial Neural Network on [Wine Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine)
Its built from scratch using Keras in Python.
The attributes are 
1) Alcohol
2) Malic acid
3) Ash
4) Alcalinity of ash
5) Magnesium
6) Total phenols
7) Flavanoids
8) Nonflavanoid phenols
9) Proanthocyanins<br/>
10)Color intensity<br/>
11)Hue
12)OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
13)Proline
<br/>

During data preprocessing phase, I have used feature elimination techniqes via Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and data visualization to reduce Computational Time to a greater extent.
